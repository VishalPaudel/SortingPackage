# SortingPackage
A well documented and well commented set of Sorting Algorithms in python, written with ❤️ by a Plaksha student for other Plaksha students. Please absorb as much as you may, and email me at vishalpaudel876@gmail.com for reporting any mistakes. Rumor has it, the one who points out mistakes of POGO, receives yummy ice cream.
